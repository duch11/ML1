 - Read the instructions on the competition website
 - Once you join the competition, you can make a submission by uploading a CSV file with your predictions to Kaggle using the big blue "Submit Predictions" button (see screenshot below).
 - There is no limit to how many submissions can be made, the best one will be shown on the [Leaderboard](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/leaderboard)
